### Project Description
Fun productivity tool tha tracks the time of focused work sessons and rewrads you with funny memes at certain intervals.It gamifies focus by showing stats like total focus time and memes unlocked, making staying on task playful and engaging.

### The Problem statement
People often lose focus or procrastinate while working or studying because traditional timers and reminders are boring or easy to ignore.

### The Solution
This tool keeps users engaged by combining a focus timer with fun rewards. It tracks how long they stay focused, and after set intervals, unlocks memes as instant, playful feedback. Users can see stats like total focus time and memes unlocked, making staying on task interactive and rewarding rather than boring.

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**
The application is a single-page web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Components:

- Timer Module – tracks focused work sessions.

- Meme Module – unlocks and displays memes based on timer intervals.

- Stats Module – maintains counters for total focus time and memes unlocked.

Data Flow:

Tech Stack Interaction:
HTML handles layout, CSS handles styling and retro/fun visuals, JS handles timer, meme unlocking logic, and stats updates.

**Application Workflow:**

Index.html is opened by user, then when user initiates tracking, the timer starts tracking focus time. At predefined intervals (here, it is 60 seconds) a meme is unlocked and displayed, while the user is said to be completed a single session. Stats panel updates the number of session, focus time and memes unlocked. The user continues session and this process continues until entire session ends. User can reset timer or reload to reset stats and timer.
